However, the check for whether the start boundary has reached the end boundary is\n\t                        expensive, so this method is slow (although unlike \"move-negative-gazillion\" is largely unaffected\n\t                        by the location of the range within the document).\n\t\n\t                        The approach used below is a hybrid of the two methods above.

For example, the CSS language definition\n\t\t\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n\t\t\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n\t\t\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n\t\t\t * this:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n\t\t\t *     // token\n\t\t\t * };\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n\t\t\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n\t\t\t *     'style': {\n\t\t\t *         // token\n\t\t\t *     }\n\t\t\t * });\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ## Special cases\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n\t\t\t * will be ignored.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n\t\t\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n\t\t\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\n\t\t\t * });\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ## Limitations\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n\t\t\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n\t\t\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n\t\t\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n\t\t\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n\t\t\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\n\t\t\t * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\n\t\t\t * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t\t * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\n\t\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\n\t\t\t * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\n\t\t\t * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\n\t\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\n\t\t\t * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\n\t\t\t * @public\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t\tinsertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\n\t\t\t\troot = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\n\t\t\t\tvar grammar = root[inside];\n\t\t\t\t/** @type {Grammar} */\n\t\t\t\tvar ret = {};\n\t\n\t\t\t\tfor (var token in grammar) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (token == before) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var newToken in insert) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Do not insert token which also occur in insert.

The facts:\n\n                        - Each line break is represented as \\r in the text node's data/nodeValue properties\n                        - Each line break is represented as \\r\\n in the TextRange's 'text' property\n                        - The 'text' property of the TextRange does not contain trailing line breaks\n\n                        To get round the problem presented by the final fact above, we can use the fact that TextRange's\n                        moveStart() and moveEnd() methods return the actual number of characters moved, which is not\n                        necessarily the same as the number of characters it was instructed to move. The simplest approach is\n                        to use this to store the characters moved when moving both the start and end of the range to the\n                        start of the document body and subtracting the start offset from the end offset (the\n                        \"move-negative-gazillion\" method). However, this is extremely slow when the document is large and\n                        the range is near the end of it. Clearly doing the mirror image (i.e. moving the range boundaries to\n                        the end of the document) has the same problem.\n\n                        Another approach that works is to use moveStart() to move the start boundary of the range up to the\n                        end boundary one character at a time and incrementing a counter with the value returned by the\n                        moveStart() call. However, the check for whether the start boundary has reached the end boundary is\n                        expensive, so this method is slow (although unlike \"move-negative-gazillion\" is largely unaffected\n                        by the location of the range within the document).\n\n                        The approach used below is a hybrid of the two methods above. It uses the fact that a string\n                        containing the TextRange's 'text' property with each \\r\\n converted to a single \\r character cannot\n                        be longer than the text of the TextRange, so the start of the range is moved that length initially\n                        and then a character at a time to make up for any trailing line breaks not contained in the 'text'\n                        property. This has good performance in most situations compared to the previous two methods.\n                        */\n                        var tempRange = workingRange.duplicate();\n                        var rangeLength = tempRange.text.replace(/\\r\\n/g, \"\\r\").length;\n\n                        offset = tempRange.moveStart(\"character\", rangeLength);\n                        while ( (comparison = tempRange.compareEndPoints(\"StartToEnd\", tempRange)) == -1) {\n                            offset++;\n                            tempRange.moveStart(\"character\", 1);\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        offset = workingRange.text.length;\n                    }\n                    boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(boundaryNode, offset);\n                } else {\n\n                    // If the boundary immediately follows a character data node and this is the end boundary, we should favour\n                    // a position within that, and likewise for a start boundary preceding a character data node\n                    previousNode = (isCollapsed || !isStart) && workingNode.previousSibling;\n                    nextNode = (isCollapsed || isStart) && workingNode.nextSibling;\n                    if (nextNode && isCharacterDataNode(nextNode)) {\n                        boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(nextNode, 0);\n                    } else if (previousNode && isCharacterDataNode(previousNode)) {\n                        boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(previousNode, previousNode.data.length);\n                    } else {\n                        boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(containerElement, dom.getNodeIndex(workingNode));\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Clean up\n                dom.removeNode(workingNode);\n\n                return {\n                    boundaryPosition: boundaryPosition,\n                    nodeInfo: {\n                        nodeIndex: nodeIndex,\n                        containerElement: containerElement\n                    }\n                };\n            };\n\n            // Returns a TextRange representing the boundary of a TextRange expressed as a node and an offset within that\n            // node.

For example, the CSS language definition\n\t\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n\t\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n\t\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n\t\t * this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n\t\t *     // token\n\t\t * };\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n\t\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n\t\t *     'style': {\n\t\t *         // token\n\t\t *     }\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Special cases\n\t\t *\n\t\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n\t\t * will be ignored.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n\t\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n\t\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Limitations\n\t\t *\n\t\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n\t\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n\t\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n\t\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n\t\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n\t\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced.
