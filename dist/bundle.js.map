However, the check for whether the start boundary has reached the end boundary is\n\t                        expensive, so this method is slow (although unlike \"move-negative-gazillion\" is largely unaffected\n\t                        by the location of the range within the document).\n\t\n\t                        The approach used below is a hybrid of the two methods above.

The working range is collapsed at the start of\n                    // the node containing the text range's boundary, so we move the end of the working range to the\n                    // boundary point and measure the length of its text to get the boundary's offset within the node.\n                    workingRange.setEndPoint(isStart ? \"EndToStart\" : \"EndToEnd\", textRange);\n\n                    var offset;\n\n                    if (/[\\r\\n]/.test(boundaryNode.data)) {\n                        /*\n                        For the particular case of a boundary within a text node containing rendered line breaks (within a\n                        <pre> element, for example), we need a slightly complicated approach to get the boundary's offset in\n                        IE. The facts:\n\n                        - Each line break is represented as \\r in the text node's data/nodeValue properties\n                        - Each line break is represented as \\r\\n in the TextRange's 'text' property\n                        - The 'text' property of the TextRange does not contain trailing line breaks\n\n                        To get round the problem presented by the final fact above, we can use the fact that TextRange's\n                        moveStart() and moveEnd() methods return the actual number of characters moved, which is not\n                        necessarily the same as the number of characters it was instructed to move. The simplest approach is\n                        to use this to store the characters moved when moving both the start and end of the range to the\n                        start of the document body and subtracting the start offset from the end offset (the\n                        \"move-negative-gazillion\" method). However, this is extremely slow when the document is large and\n                        the range is near the end of it. Clearly doing the mirror image (i.e. moving the range boundaries to\n                        the end of the document) has the same problem.\n\n                        Another approach that works is to use moveStart() to move the start boundary of the range up to the\n                        end boundary one character at a time and incrementing a counter with the value returned by the\n                        moveStart() call. However, the check for whether the start boundary has reached the end boundary is\n                        expensive, so this method is slow (although unlike \"move-negative-gazillion\" is largely unaffected\n                        by the location of the range within the document).\n\n                        The approach used below is a hybrid of the two methods above. It uses the fact that a string\n                        containing the TextRange's 'text' property with each \\r\\n converted to a single \\r character cannot\n                        be longer than the text of the TextRange, so the start of the range is moved that length initially\n                        and then a character at a time to make up for any trailing line breaks not contained in the 'text'\n                        property. This has good performance in most situations compared to the previous two methods.\n                        */\n                        var tempRange = workingRange.duplicate();\n                        var rangeLength = tempRange.text.replace(/\\r\\n/g, \"\\r\").length;\n\n                        offset = tempRange.moveStart(\"character\", rangeLength);\n                        while ( (comparison = tempRange.compareEndPoints(\"StartToEnd\", tempRange)) == -1) {\n                            offset++;\n                            tempRange.moveStart(\"character\", 1);\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        offset = workingRange.text.length;\n                    }\n                    boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(boundaryNode, offset);\n                } else {\n\n                    // If the boundary immediately follows a character data node and this is the end boundary, we should favour\n                    // a position within that, and likewise for a start boundary preceding a character data node\n                    previousNode = (isCollapsed || !isStart) && workingNode.previousSibling;\n                    nextNode = (isCollapsed || isStart) && workingNode.nextSibling;\n                    if (nextNode && isCharacterDataNode(nextNode)) {\n                        boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(nextNode, 0);\n                    } else if (previousNode && isCharacterDataNode(previousNode)) {\n                        boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(previousNode, previousNode.data.length);\n                    } else {\n                        boundaryPosition = new DomPosition(containerElement, dom.getNodeIndex(workingNode));\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Clean up\n                dom.removeNode(workingNode);\n\n                return {\n                    boundaryPosition: boundaryPosition,\n                    nodeInfo: {\n                        nodeIndex: nodeIndex,\n                        containerElement: containerElement\n                    }\n                };\n            };\n\n            // Returns a TextRange representing the boundary of a TextRange expressed as a node and an offset within that\n            // node.
